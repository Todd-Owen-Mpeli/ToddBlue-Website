##  ToddBue website
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Shoe & clothing merchandise website project I created to demonstrate my Server side Rendering knowledge & general web development skills. Specifically, Next.js, HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript /jQuery, Git/ Github. 

##  Thought Process
As a junior software Developer my main responsibilities would be working with the Project manager, UX/UI design team, Senior developer & Sales and Marketing team alongside a existing web development team. Each responsible for managing, developing, maintaining, and supporting various web projects.

This project displays that communications with clients, client briefs & project details will larging be all pre-determined. Although I will have some interactions with clients, I won't be responsible for designing an entire website functionality.

However, I will be required to build features, functions and have a minimum understanding of design principles, example the difference between padding and margin.

Image Optimization for Web Performance without Losing Quality.. I reduced the product images resolution from (2024px by 2024px) down to (1280px by 1280px).

# Project Context
Most of my projects are developed using Client-Side rendering. And this project I wanted to develop a website using Next.js framework, specifically the Server Side Rendering development process. I wanted to expand my knowledge in next.js and and begin into developing with react and react components.

1. Develop a website using Next.js framework.
2. Learn react components in next.js.
3. Show my ability to learn Server Side Rendering.

# My Objective
To learn Next.js framework to be able to rebuild my web developer portfolio using Server Side Rendering development process.

# Lessons Learned
I learned a lot building this application. But mainly how to utilise MYSQL / JSON file structure for data fetching. In the new product page, each product displayed, the infomation such as: product name, product category and pricing is using a data fetching JSON file structure. The JSON file is mannually downloaded locally from a mySQL database and instead of me manually inserting the data into the tags I had to fetch the data as if it was from a database. 

multiple scss styling files for multiple pages. Alternatively how to build reusable content components, such as the navigation and footer.js files.

1. Reusable content components in multiple pages. (Navbar.js & Footer.js)
2. Reusable Custom reusable Animation Properties/Objects with framer-motion.
3. SCSS File Structure for multiple pages. (_newPage.scss, _storePage.scss etc.)
4. Git operations specifically init, add, status, commit, remote, push and pull.
5. Creating a remote repository on github but deploying my next.js project with vercel.
6. Responsive website using media queries for mobile & tablet view-width breakpoints.

# Personal Improvements
Although I have a fairly good understanding of javascript, enought to make a website user Interactive. I am interested to learn more of next.js. I'd like to create more reusable content components. Most specifically utilise style components more often than scss file structure.

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
